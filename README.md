### amqAnswerTimeDiference.user.js
- Slightly altered Hotkey Functions plugin to nicely work with multiple input boxes on Song Artist mode
- Some popular titles may not be there because they weren't in the expand library too. You can let me know by creating an issue in this github repo. Make sure to respond to your issue if you find more missing titles instead of creating a new one everytime.

Shoutout to Zol, Joseph and Ayuu, their code helped me to write the things above.
